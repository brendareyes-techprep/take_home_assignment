# Take home assignment
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to do this assignment, below I will list my thought process and how I tackled this.
## Starting 
1. Starting off, I knew I had to make a plan on how to tackle this. 
2. I wanted to start off by created a map, mapping out where everything is according to the screens and marking where everything is. 

## Mapping
1. In a drawing by hand I have marked and planned where everything will go with names exactly. 
2. Based on my map I want to code from the bottom most layer to the top which means starting with the background. 
3. After establishing the background I will start on the side bar.
    - From here I can start from the top down, meaning starting with the DPI logo, the "Courses" and "Log out" and then working down to the user profile picture
